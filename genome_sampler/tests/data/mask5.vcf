##	seq_end = Alignment ends are affected by low coverage and high error rates(masking recommended, but might be more stringent than necessary)
##	ambiguous = Sites which show an excess of ambiguous basecalls relative to the number of alternative alleles, often emerging from a single country or sequencing laboratory
##	amended = Previous sequencing errors which now appear to have been fixed in the latest versions of the GISAID sequences, at least in sequences from some of the sequencing laboratories
##	highly_ambiguous = Sites with a very high proportion of ambiguous characters, relative to the number of alternative alleles
##	highly_homoplasic = Positions which are extremely homoplasic - it is sometimes not necessarily clear if these are hypermutable sites or sequencing artefacts
##	homoplasic = Homoplasic sites, with many mutation events needed to explain a relatively small alternative allele count
##	interspecific_contamination = Cases (so far only one instance) in which the known sequencing issue is due to contamination from genetic material that does not have SARS-CoV-2 origin
##	nanopore_adapter = Cases in which the known sequencing issue is due to the adapter sequences in nanopore reads
##	narrow_src = Variants which are found in sequences from only a few sequencing labs (usually two or three), possibly as a consequence of the same artefact reproduced independently
##	neighbour_linked = Proximal variants displaying near perfect linkage
##	single_src = Only observed in samples from a single laboratory
