              is a user-friendly and widely used software package for
              phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood. Since the
              release of version 1 in 2014, we have continuously expanded
              IQ-TREE to integrate a plethora of new models of sequence
              evolution and efficient computational approaches of phylogenetic
              inference to deal with genomic data. Here, we describe notable
              features of IQ-TREE version 2 and highlight the key advantages
              over other software.",

               GISAID must be subsampled to enable computationally feasible
               phylogenetic and other analyses. We present genome-sampler, a
               software package that supports sampling collections of viral
               genomes across multiple axes including time of genome isolation,
               location of genome isolation, and viral diversity. The software
               is modular in design so that these or future sampling approaches
               can be applied independently and combined (or replaced with a
               random sampling approach) to facilitate custom workflows and
               benchmarking. genome-sampler is written as a QIIME 2 plugin,
               ensuring that its application is fully reproducible through
               QIIME 2's unique retrospective data provenance tracking system.
               genome-sampler can be installed in a conda environment on macOS
               or Linux systems. A complete default pipeline is available
               through a Snakemake workflow, so subsampling can be achieved
               using a single command. genome-sampler is open source, free for
               all to use, and available at
               https://caporasolab.us/genome-sampler . We hope that this will
               facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research and support evaluation of viral
               genome sampling approaches for genomic epidemiology.",

  title    = "{VSEARCH}: a versatile open source tool for metagenomics",
  author   = "Rognes, Torbj{\o}rn and Flouri, Tom{\'a}{\v s} and Nichols, Ben
              and Quince, Christopher and Mah{\'e}, Fr{\'e}d{\'e}ric",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge
              multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing
              metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide
              sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely
              used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not
              publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily
              described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely
              available for academic use. METHODS: When searching nucleotide
              sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by
              the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify
              similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in
              USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment
              of the query against potential target sequences, using full
              dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used
              by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using
              vectorisation and multiple threads. RESULTS: VSEARCH includes
              most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in
              USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH
              version 8, including searching (exact or based on global
              alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting,
              abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection
              (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or
              prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting,
              and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file
              processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality
              statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH
              extends functionality with several new commands and improvements,
              including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity
              sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among
              different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format
              conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than
              USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection
              and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read
              merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing
              clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when
              performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is
              available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the
              BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version
              3.0. DISCUSSION: VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate
              and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source
              versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the
              metagenomics community.",
