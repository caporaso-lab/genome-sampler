              phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood. Since the
              release of version 1 in 2014, we have continuously expanded
              IQ-TREE to integrate a plethora of new models of sequence
              evolution and efficient computational approaches of phylogenetic
              inference to deal with genomic data. Here, we describe notable

              adjustment of direction in nucleotide alignment, constrained
              alignment and parallel processing, which were implemented after

              examples incorrectly aligned by MAFFT are also shown to clarify
              its limitations. We discuss how to avoid misalignments, and our
              ongoing efforts to overcome such limitations.",
