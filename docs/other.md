## Sampling focal sequences

`genome-sampler` can be used for sampling focal sequences in addition to
context sequences. In fact, all of the exact same sampling approaches can
be applied in exactly the same way. The only additional file you'll need to do
this (relative to the files used in {ref}`usage-tutorial`) is a focal sequence
metadata file. This can mirror the format of the context sequence metadata
file. For more details on the format of these files, see
[Metadata in QIIME 2](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/metadata/).

(parallel)=
## Running in parallel

`genome-sampler` can be run in parallel to speed it up. This is done in
different ways depending on whether you're running the steps individually or
through Snakemake.

If you're using Snakemake, you need only pass additional cores (via
`snakemake --cores N`). The parallelizable steps will automatically use the
provided resources.

If you're running the steps individually you can pass the `--p-n-threads`
option to several of the commands. For example, `sample-diversity` is the
slowest step in the workflow. You can provide the `--p-n-threads` parameter to
run it in parallel:

```
qiime genome-sampler sample-diversity \
 --i-context-seqs filtered-context-seqs.qza \
 --p-percent-id 0.9995 \
 --o-selection diversity-selection.qza \
 --p-n-threads N
```

When running this command, you should set `N` to be the number of available
processors or cores on a single node of your system. For example, on a
cluster that has nodes with 28 cores, you could run:

```
qiime genome-sampler sample-diversity \
 --i-context-seqs filtered-context-seqs.qza \
 --p-percent-id 0.9995 \
 --o-selection diversity-selection.qza \
 --p-n-threads 28
```

This would use all of the resources on a single node of that cluster. In the
future QIIME 2 will have support for splitting workflows like this across
multiple cluster nodes, but we do not have this support now.

(adapting-tutorial)=
## Adapting Snakemake workflow for application to your own data
The Snakemake workflow presented in the tutorial is a good starting point for
your own analyses. There are typically a few things to do to adapt
`Snakefile` for your own data. These changes will be made to the `config.yaml`
file which should be found alongside the `Snakefile`.

1. Modify input filepaths as needed. The input filepaths listed correspond to
the names of the files provided for the tutorial. You can either name your
files using those names, or update the input filepath values.
2. Modify output filepaths if you'd like these to be different from the ones
used in the tutorial.
3. Modify longitudinal, neighbor, and diversity sampling parameters as
desired. If you end up experimenting with different values for these
parameters, which we encourage, we would love to hear about your findings. Be
aware that increasing the `*_percent_id` parameters will increase the runtime
of your analysis, and decreasing those values will decrease the runtime of your
analysis.

(alignment-mask)=
## Pre-computed alignment mask

We provide support for masking alignments with the pre-computed mask
provided [here](https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2). Like the
rest of our {ref}`alignment and phylogenetics workflow <downstream>`,
this is experimental. Let us know how it works for you. It would be very useful
to hear about how your final results (e.g., a phylogenetic tree) computed
using this mask compares to one created with your own custom mask.

(removing-sequences)=
## Removing sequences present in both focal and context sequence collections

As many researchers are rapidly submitting their sequence data to public
repositories, sometimes your focal sequences may be present in context
sequences that you obtain from a public repository. You can use QIIME 2 to
remove those sequences from your context sequence collection.

First, visualize your focal sequence and context sequence collections with
QIIME 2 to confirm that you know what QIIME 2 considers to be the sequence
identifiers. You can do this by running the following two commands:

```
qiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \
 --i-data focal-seqs.qza \
 --o-visualization focal-seqs.qzv

qiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \
 --i-data context-seqs.qza \
 --o-visualization context-seqs.qzv
```

Then, load the two visualizations with [QIIME 2 View](https://view.qiime2.org).
The values in the _Feature ID_ column are the sequence ids. If the ids of the
sequences that you want to remove are the same across your two data sets, you
can follow the steps under {ref}`shared-identifiers`. If the identifiers you
want to remove are not the same across your two data sets, or you're not sure,
follow the steps under {ref}`differing-identifiers`.

(shared-identifiers)=
### Shared identifiers

If your sequence identifiers are identical across your focal and context
sequence collections, you can remove context sequences that are also focal
sequences as follows:

```
qiime feature-table filter-seqs\
 --i-data context-seqs.qza \
 --m-metadata-file focal-metadata.tsv \
 --p-exclude-ids \
 --o-filtered-data filtered-context-seqs.qza
```

All of your downstream analysis steps should then use the resulting
`filtered-context-seqs.qza` file.

Alternatively, if you want to remove these sequences from your focal sequence
collection, you could do this as follows:

```
qiime feature-table filter-seqs\
 --i-data focal-seqs.qza \
 --m-metadata-file context-metadata.tsv \
 --p-exclude-ids \
 --o-filtered-data filtered-focal-seqs.qza
```

(differing-identifiers)=
### Differing identifiers
If your sequence identifiers differ across your focal and context sequences (or
you're not sure if they're the same or if they differ), you can perform a
metadata-based filtering of your sequences. The easiest way to approach this
is to add a new column to your context sequence metadata file
(`context-metadata.tsv` in the tutorial), with a column header like
`is-focal-sequence`. You can do this with your
favorite spreadsheet editor. For all of the sequences you would like to remove,
add the value `TRUE` to this column. For all of the sequences you would like to
retain, add the value `FALSE` to this column. Then, save the file and run the
following command:

```
qiime feature-table filter-seqs \
 --i-data context-seqs.qza \
 --m-metadata-file context-metadata.tsv \
 --p-where "[is_focal_sequence]='FALSE'" \
 --o-filtered-data filtered-context-seqs.qza
```

This will create a new file, `filtered-context-seqs.qza`, which only contains
the sequences that you indicated were not focal sequences in the context
metadata. All of your downstream analysis steps should then use the resulting
`filtered-context-seqs.qza` file.

Alternatively, if you want to remove sequences from your focal sequence
collection instead of from your context sequence collection, you can edit your
focal sequence metadata file, and then use that to filter in the same way that
context sequences were filtered here.

```{note}
If your metadata file already contains a column that differentiates the
sequences you want to remove from the sequences you want to retain, it's not
necessary to add a new column. Instead, you can design a value for the
``--p-where`` parameter that will allow the filter to operate on data from
that column. For more information on metadata-based filtering, see
[Metadata-based filtering](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.8/tutorials/filtering/#metadata-based-filtering)
in the QIIME 2 documentation.
